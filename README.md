## Requirements Addressed  
- **Requirement 1**: MVMM is implemented into all three of our screens, demonstrated by how our screens get information from backend, process information in the ViewModel, and then present the information to the screen, all in separate files
- **Requirement 2**: Our first screen enables the user to login/signup, our second screen shows the gyms, our third screen displays excercises
- **Requirement 3**: We use our backend to login/signup our user, get the lazylist of excercises, and show the gyms and their fullness
